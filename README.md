# Holistic_Cyber_Threat_Intelligence_System_with_BERT_for_Advanced_threat_Detection
The AI Integrated Cyber Threat Intelligence System is a comprehensive platform designed to
enhance cybersecurity through the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language
processing (NLP), specifically leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers), to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured textual data. The
system utilizes AI-driven models to collect, interpret, and disseminate critical threat
intelligence, sourced from a wide range of inputs such as security reports, threat feeds, and
social media, with a focus on real-time threat detection and vulnerability mitigation.
A core component of this system is BERT, which is used to extract and classify relevant threat
intelligence from unstructured data, including the identification of Indicators of Compromise
(IOCs), threat actors, and attack methods. By understanding the context and semantics of
language in security-related content, BERT improves the accuracy of threat detection and
enables better decision-making in response to emerging cyber threats.
The system also enhances Threat Intelligence Contextualization, enabling richer analysis
by providing detailed risk scoring, impact assessment, and geospatial context for each
detected threat. By cross-referencing threat intelligence with internal data, the platform can
generate customized threat assessments that help prioritize incidents based on severity,
likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact, ensuring a focused and efficient response.
By combining cutting-edge NLP techniques, AI-driven analysis, and seamless integration with
external threat-sharing platforms, this system empowers organizations to not only detect and
respond to cyber threats in real time but also contextual understanding to defend against
increasingly sophisticated attacks
